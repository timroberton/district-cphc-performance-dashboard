        Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) performance measurement
        framework and index for India
      </h2>
      <h3 class="heading-3">Background</h3>
      <p class="">
        Strong primary health care has been recognized as critical to achieving
        Universal Health Coverage (UHC), and to meeting the global Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDG) targets. As a first step to improving primary
        health care, several efforts have been made to examine and measure its
        performance including the ones developed by the Primary Health Care
        Performance Improvement network, the World Health Organization (WHO) –
        United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and Canadian Institute for
        Health Information.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        In India too, the need for developing a performance measurement
        framework for comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) has been felt
        recently- at both national and subnational levels. The recently launched
        Ayushman Bharat program aims to strengthen peripheral health centres
        that provide free care to people- termed as Health and Wellness Centres
        (HWC) . This program presents a new opportunity for strengthening CPHC
        in India by understanding the HWC intervention better and measuring the
        performance of CPHC in India in the light of these new reforms.
      </p>

        Why do we need a CPHC performance measurement framework specific to
        India?
      </h4>
      <ol class=" list-outside list-disc space-y-2 pl-4">
        <li class="">
          There is no existing source that provides standardized, comprehensive
          information on the delivery of primary health care services across the
          country.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          There are currently no locally developed primary health care
          performance frameworks that capture unique aspects and
          values/priorities of India’s health system and policies. The
          transnational frameworks available are generalized frameworks and need
          to be adapted to the Indian policy context.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          We need a performance framework that can link to locally available
          data sources and minimize the burden of collecting additional data.

        District level comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) performance
        measurement
      </h3>
      <p class="">
        The India Primary Healthcare Support Initiative (IPSI) has been working
        with Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to develop a district-level
        CPHC performance measurement framework and index. While the index is
        envisaged to be used to measure CPHC performance in all districts across
        the country, in its current pilot phase it is being constructed for all
        districts in three states: Gujarat, Odisha and Meghalaya.

      <h4 class="heading-4">District CPHC performance measurement framework</h4>
      <img src="/images/framework.png" alt="" class="w-full max-w-[800px]" />
      <p class="">
        Domains represent the three broad themes in the framework, namely-
        capacity, service delivery and impact. Sub-domains are the
        sub-categories under each domain, for example, capacity domain includes
        four sub-domains of structures, inputs, community engagement and quality
        assurance. Each sub-domain further consists of select, district-level
        indicators. Currently, there are 35 indicators used to estimate the
        district level CPHC performance measurement index.
      </p>
      <ul class=" list-outside list-disc space-y-2 pl-4">
        <li class="">
          Capacity – This domain captures elements that reflect the resource
          needs for CPHC, such as PHC financing, information systems, medicines
          and diagnostics, and community linkages. Quality assurance has been
          added under the capacity domain to reflect the national priorities of
          quality assurance mechanisms that further improve the capacity of
          HWCs. There are 4 sub-domains and 12 indicators under this domain.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Service delivery – Service delivery outputs and population level
          outcomes of CPHC such as service coverage are included in this domain.
          Sub-domains have been categorized corresponding to the 12 HWC packages
          for which data were available. In total, there are 4 sub-domains and
          14 indicators under this domain.
        </li>
        <li class="">
          Impact – The impact domain comprises health outcome indicators
          measured at population level. Similar to the service delivery domain,
          sub-domains are categorized as per the 12 HWC packages, for which data
          were available. There are 3 sub-domains and 9 indicators under the
          impact domain.

      <h3 class="heading-3">About the project</h3>
      <p class="">
        India Primary Healthcare Support Initiative (IPSI) based in the
        Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
        of Public Health, was established in July 2020. Funded by the Bill &
        Melinda Gates Foundation, the initiative aims to support the important
        government initiatives to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care
        (CPHC). The initiative is in partnership with the All India Institute of
        Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS-D), the national partner for this
        project. IPSI also works in collaboration with the National Health
        System Resource Centre (NHSRC), Government of India.
